Actors, on strike since July 14, are likewise seeking better compensation from streaming. But they are also demanding [safeguards against AI](https://apnews.com/article/hollywood-ai-strike-wga-artificial-intelligence-39ab72582c3a15f77510c9c30a45ffc8), which can potentially use a star’s likeness without his or her permission or replace background actors entirely.
- Might teachers face similar existential concerns?
- Isn't all this acknowledgment of the power of AI?
- What exactly are the ethics of copyright and patents?
- Didn't pharmaceutics make exemptions of HIV/AIDS drugs?
- Exemptions for low income countries leading to PEPFAR?

Can't we use this narrative for AI and education in low income countries:
- Clearly ChatGPT is powerful enough to make professional afraid of competition
- But if we suppose the ethics of copyright to the data on which ChatGPT are addressed:
- Then can't we by analogy go ahead with a PEPFAR equivalent for education:
- Making ChatGPT and other AI supported application accesible?
- Especially in settings beset by a student: teacher ratio > XX?

Which brings us to the main issue:
- Truth?
- Knowledge?
- Ethics?
- What is the purpose of education?
- For settings with high student: teacher ratio AI serves an `empowering`, ethical end
