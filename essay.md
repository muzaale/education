**Essay Title:** 
AI in Education: Navigating the Future through Agency Theory and Checklists

**Introduction:** 
In the wake of the groundbreaking [success of ChatGPT](https://www.demandsage.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Road-To-100-Million-Users-For-Various-Platforms.png), the debate surrounding the role of Artificial Intelligence [(AI) in education](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/generative-artificial-intelligence-education-what-are-opportunities-and-challenges) has intensified. Is AI merely a tool, or is it [an agent with responsibilities and duties?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2uEAgLeOzA) Drawing parallels from aviation and medicine, where [checklists have been instrumental](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/10/the-checklist) in reducing failure rates, we propose a framework grounded in [agency theory](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Principal–agent_problem_variantion_1.svg/320px-Principal–agent_problem_variantion_1.svg.png) to evaluate and integrate AI in education.

**Section 1: The Role of AI - Beyond a Tool:** 
- **Brief overview:** The rapid advancements in AI, exemplified by ChatGPT.
- **Defining AI as an Agent:** Presenting AI not just as a tool but as an agent with its own set of responsibilities.
  - When parent sends their child to school, they are entrusting their children's education in the hands of another agent
  - They do this because of limitated time in the modern world, limited knowledge of specific topics, etc
  - Although AI may not be able to initiate goals and tasks on its own, it is more helpful to think of it as an agent rather than mere tool
  - Once you do this you unravel well-established problems arising from misaligned conflicts between the principal and agent
  - Even without an explicit goal from AI, we can treat its outcomes as if they arise from the a deliberate intension (attribute agency)
    
- **Teacher/Parent as Principal:** Highlighting the relationship dynamics between AI (agent) and educators/parents (principals).
  - Concerns among striking workers in hollywood about AI replacing them speak to how powerful ChatGPT is perceived to be in the real world
  - If teachers have similar concerns about being replaced by AI then its important to learn some lessons from hollywood
  - But in brief, the march of AI is being driven by nations and companies trying to grab an early advantage
  - So its only going to get better with time and any concessions striking workers make now could be holding back progress
  - Progress may mean lower costs, higher efficiency, improved access to quality
  - All this is especially pertinent in low-income remote settings with high student-teacher ratios
  - One-size fits all education curriculums can be tailored to the individual; this is the future
  - Helpful to think of reactions to ChatGPT from the perspective of innovation, production, and regulation
  - To inform these perspectives in light of our limited understanding of the potential of AI, we propose a checklist

**Section 2: The Power of Checklists:** 
- **Historical Context:** The adoption and success of checklists in aviation and medicine to ensure systematic and thorough task completion.
- **Checklists in Education:** Discussing the existing checklists used to evaluate teachers, especially in low-income, remote settings with limited resources.

**Section 3: Adapting Agency Theory to AI in Education:** 
- **Understanding Agency Theory:** A brief overview and its traditional application in assessing the principal-agent relationship.
- **AI Agent Evaluation Checklist:** Introduce the adapted checklist for AI's role in education, ensuring its alignment with educational objectives, transparency, ethical considerations, and more.

**Section 4: Vision for 2034 - AI's Global Trajectory:** 
- **America's LLMs:** Discussing America's articulated goal to lead in LLMs and the competitive edge this might offer.
- **China's Humanoid Robots:** Highlighting China's potential leadership in humanoid AI-powered robots, driven by its skilled labor force.
- **Europe's Regulatory Role:** Emphasizing the EU's influential position in AI regulations, drawing from its history of industrial leadership and market size.

**Section 5: The Future - Innovation, Production, and Regulation:** 
- **Innovation:** Encouraging educators to collaborate with innovators, ensuring AI technologies are tailored to educational needs.
- **Production:** Recognizing the potential of humanoid AI-powered robots and the strategic positioning of nations in this domain.
- **Regulation:** Addressing the challenges faced by regulators, proposing the checklist as a transparent, adaptable tool to navigate the complexities of AI in education.

**Section 6: The Ultimate Goal - Educating the Next Generation:** 
- **Reaffirming the Principal-Agent Relationship:** Emphasizing that parents, as principals, have outsourced education to teachers, and now potentially to AI. 
- **Checklists for Success:** Advocating for the application of checklists, grounded in agency theory, to ensure the successful integration of AI in education.
- **Closing Thoughts:** While AI holds immense promise, it should be viewed as a supplementary force in education. The human touch, provided by teachers, remains irreplaceable.

**Conclusion:** 
The world post-ChatGPT presents us with an opportunity to reimagine education. By applying agency theory and adopting a checklist approach, we can navigate the challenges and potentials of integrating AI into our classrooms. By 2034, with the right frameworks in place, we could witness an educational landscape where AI not only supports but elevates the learning experience for students globally.
