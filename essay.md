**Section 3: Adapting Agency Theory to AI in Education:** 

**Understanding Agency Theory:** 
Agency Theory, originally rooted in economics, focuses on resolving issues that can arise in agency relationships, especially when the goals of the principal and agent clash or when it is challenging and expensive for the principal to verify the agent's actions. In the context of education, traditionally, the principal (parents or school boards) delegates the responsibility of education to the agent (teachers). The principal’s goal is the effective education of their child, while the teacher, as the agent, is tasked with ensuring this through their expertise. However, the introduction of AI complicates this relationship. If we view AI as another agent, it's crucial to ensure that this new agent's goals align with those of the principal, just as we would for human agents.
