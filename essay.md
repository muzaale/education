**Essay Title:** 
AI in Education: Navigating the Future through Agency Theory and Checklists

**Introduction:** 
In the wake of the groundbreaking success of ChatGPT, the debate surrounding the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education has intensified. Is AI merely a tool, or is it an agent with responsibilities and duties? Drawing parallels from aviation and medicine, where checklists have been instrumental in reducing failure rates, we propose a framework grounded in agency theory to evaluate and integrate AI in education.

**Section 1: The Role of AI - Beyond a Tool:** 
- **Brief overview:** The rapid advancements in AI, exemplified by ChatGPT.
- **Defining AI as an Agent:** Presenting AI not just as a tool but as an agent with its own set of responsibilities.
- **Teacher/Parent as Principal:** Highlighting the relationship dynamics between AI (agent) and educators/parents (principals).

**Section 2: The Power of Checklists:** 
- **Historical Context:** The adoption and success of checklists in aviation and medicine to ensure systematic and thorough task completion.
- **Checklists in Education:** Discussing the existing checklists used to evaluate teachers, especially in low-income, remote settings with limited resources.

**Section 3: Adapting Agency Theory to AI in Education:** 
- **Understanding Agency Theory:** A brief overview and its traditional application in assessing the principal-agent relationship.
- **AI Agent Evaluation Checklist:** Introduce the adapted checklist for AI's role in education, ensuring its alignment with educational objectives, transparency, ethical considerations, and more.

**Section 4: Vision for 2034 - AI's Global Trajectory:** 
- **America's LLMs:** Discussing America's articulated goal to lead in LLMs and the competitive edge this might offer.
- **China's Humanoid Robots:** Highlighting China's potential leadership in humanoid AI-powered robots, driven by its skilled labor force.
- **Europe's Regulatory Role:** Emphasizing the EU's influential position in AI regulations, drawing from its history of industrial leadership and market size.

**Section 5: The Future - Innovation, Production, and Regulation:** 
- **Innovation:** Encouraging educators to collaborate with innovators, ensuring AI technologies are tailored to educational needs.
- **Production:** Recognizing the potential of humanoid AI-powered robots and the strategic positioning of nations in this domain.
- **Regulation:** Addressing the challenges faced by regulators, proposing the checklist as a transparent, adaptable tool to navigate the complexities of AI in education.

**Section 6: The Ultimate Goal - Educating the Next Generation:** 
- **Reaffirming the Principal-Agent Relationship:** Emphasizing that parents, as principals, have outsourced education to teachers, and now potentially to AI. 
- **Checklists for Success:** Advocating for the application of checklists, grounded in agency theory, to ensure the successful integration of AI in education.
- **Closing Thoughts:** While AI holds immense promise, it should be viewed as a supplementary force in education. The human touch, provided by teachers, remains irreplaceable.

**Conclusion:** 
The world post-ChatGPT presents us with an opportunity to reimagine education. By applying agency theory and adopting a checklist approach, we can navigate the challenges and potentials of integrating AI into our classrooms. By 2034, with the right frameworks in place, we could witness an educational landscape where AI not only supports but elevates the learning experience for students globally.
