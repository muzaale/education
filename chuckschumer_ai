- watermarking: folks should know its AI generated

- There are guard-rails

- Chuck Schumar: Guard rails: explainability, transparency for the average person.
- America is entrepreneural that gives us a big advantage over China
- But China is going to give hundreds of billions to AI

- Doesn't want to move too fast (look at the EU)
- Has the EU moved too fast? (now they are backing off)
- Eric Schmidt: I don't understand these algorithms
- It affects everything !
- Rapidly evolving
- AI has no history!
- Why we are having these forums to provide granularity
- Not gonna be days or weeks. But not years either. Months
- Approach with humility: its gonna be hard
   - But perfection should be the enemy of good
- We are in the arena: if we don't do it, who would?
- Can't afford to be left behind!!
- Millions of people were hurt by globalization
   - Workforce: how many lose jobs?
   - How do we train for future?
   - Impact: finance, healthcare
      - Built-in bias in the systems
      - Centuries of discrimination built into data
- What keeps Chuck Schumar awake?
   - Progress is too rapid
   - How can humanity keep pace?
- Biden will have executive order on AI on Monday
   - Migration
   - Work

- Military and defense 
   - They say we need to go fast on AI

- We are China Hawks
   - If we don't do it China will get ahead of us

- The US is ahead
   - But the gap is narrowing
   - So... 
- A lot of time we think of AI we think of softward, but hardware?
   - US developed most of the techologies especially the software
   - China has incredible ambitons to catchup 
   - Have demonstrated abilities to even surpass in other industries
- A decade ago models had about 2 billion parameters
- Now the models are at 2 trillion parameters
- Thats 100,000-fold increase in resources
- Creates pressure on the supplychain
- Particularly GPUs produced by `NVidia`
- TSMC production highest in Taiwan
- If China are falling back they might invade Taiwan
- History of warfare: punctuated by asymmetries in technology 
   - Shift ballance of power

- Alexandr Wang
   - What keeps him awake at night
   - Cyber attacks facilitated by AI

- Gita Gopinath
   - Complement
   - Substitute
   - Labor & productivity
   - The cost of error (clerical work vs. radiology)
      - When cost of error is high, unlikely to replace human
- Economies look for the next boost of productivity
   - AI is the most promising 
- What keeps her up at night
   - The speed at which the tech is progressive
   - Versus the speed at which policy makers can keep pace
   - Multiple dimensions of industries affected
   - Driven by private money

- People adopting AI are helping their clients a lot (personalized medicine, personalized financial tools)
   - generative AI is just a sliver of whats out there
   - but its grabbed peoples attention

- Generative AI is helping the developer community a lot
   - Intel brings software and hardware together 
   - Open source software, hardware 
   - Melvin Greer

- International competition
   - Geopolitics
   - Extremely important part of what we are doing

- What is shocking is
   - How human-like they are
   - And thats the danger too
   - Alan Turin
      - Machine that is indistinguishable from human
      - Thats is dangerous 
      - Capacity for deception is off-the-charts
      - Voice fakes, videos
      - But even in knowledge?

- What does AI do for information economy?
   - Cutout content producers?
      - Where does the data come from to train?
      - Most of the data are from western europe and north america
      - Stereotypes are amplified 
      - Its clear we are amplifying biases (from webscrapes)
      - Privacy?
- Big tech:: Meredith Whittaker (feminist), President Signal
   - Relies on massive surveillance 
   - Incentivizes commercialization of data
   - Bigger is better is better of AI
   - Inferences about our communities
   - Apple has few incentives to lie
   - People run performance benchmarks on iPhones
   - But economy based a data center eliminates transparency
   - Loses husband for hour on hour: AI + coding 
   - Writers Guild, SAAG, Uber & Lift
   - Capitalism
      - Growth every quarter is required
      - Thats Google
      - But also definition of cancer
      - However generative AI is "nothing"
         - ChatGPT is a simulated experience of bot
         - Its hype and its just another one & irrelevant
- Frances Haugen (more level headed)
   - Transparency is an economy; economic incentive if regulated
   - Market size: $12T for generative AI over next 10y
   - Randomized false truth (hallucination)
   - Seed misinformation -> viral (varients)

- Chief privacy and trust officer, IBM:: Christina Montgomery
   - Ethics from conception throughout the life cycle
   - Test for bias (a toolkit)
   - Explainability 
   - Don't regulate tech:: regulate the "use"
     - otherwise it will quickly get outdated

- Snehar Revanur, Founder Encode Justice 
   - Lived experience for her generation: digital natives (18yo)
   - `Algorithm` and algorithmic bias
   -  Touches on identity (ontology, epistemology of a person)
   - No surprise that white males aren't leading here

- Arati Prabhakar, White House AI chief
   - Every nation is rushing to build a future that reflects with its values
   - Kids should stepup into STEM/AI
   - AI is an extraordinary broad technology hinged on computing power
   - Info age generated data + computing power crunching it
   - This raises several concerns
   - Sort of like medicine before clinical trials
   - What keeps me up is the great and horrible things haumns can make: AI can exponentiate this
